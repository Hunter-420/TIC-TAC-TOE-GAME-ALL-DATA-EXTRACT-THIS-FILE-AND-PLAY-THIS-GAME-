But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple as you think! Try to figure out by looking ahead what the person playing against you might do next!!! If you always pay attention and look ahead, you'll never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.  You may not win, but at least you'll tie. If the game ends in a tie, don't be discouraged; most Tic Tac Toe games end this way, but a consistent strategy will ensure that you eventually win.
